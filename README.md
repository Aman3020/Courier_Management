# 📦 Courier Management System

A simple **Courier Management System** built using **C++** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. This system simulates basic courier management tasks like adding couriers, viewing orders, tracking status, and managing deliveries via a command-line interface.

---

## ✅ Features

- Add new courier orders
- Display courier details
- Update delivery status
- Track couriers by ID
- View all pending/delivered couriers
- Output automatically saved to a text file (`courier_records.txt`)
- Simple console-based interface

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- C++ Compiler (g++ recommended)
- Terminal / Command Prompt

---

## ⚙️ How to Compile & Run

1. Open terminal / command prompt in your project folder.

2. Compile the code:
```bash
g++ -o Courier_Management Courier_Management.cpp
````

3. Run the program:

```bash
./Courier_Management
```

## 📚 OOP Concepts Used

* **Classes and Objects**: For courier management.
* **Encapsulation**: Data members are private with public access methods.
* **Inheritance**: (If used, to extend classes.)
* **Polymorphism**: (Optional, via method overloading/overriding.)
* **File Handling**: Output and updates are saved to a text file.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

* Program displays a main menu after launch.
* Options include adding, viewing, updating, and tracking orders.
* Courier data is handled using objects internally.
* Order details and updates are saved in a text file (e.g. `courier_records.txt`).
* Menu loops until user chooses to exit.

---

## 📥 How to Use

1. Compile and run as shown above.
2. Use the menu to:

   * Add orders
   * View or track them
   * Update delivery status
3. Output is saved to `courier_records.txt` automatically.
